            <h2>Teakwood</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest factors while choosing your furniture is to check its durability. A lot of wooden furniture breaks easily due to wear and tear or even due to water exposure. If you have kids running around the house, or pets jumping on every surface available, you want furniture that is able to withstand their jumping. Teak wood benefits include its durability and strength. The wood is obtained from a mature teak tree. It has a dense core structure, due to which it has great strength!</p>

            <h2>Oak</h2>
            <p>An oak is a hardwood tree or shrub in the genus Quercus of the beech family. They have spirally arranged leaves, often with lobed edges, and a nut called an acorn, borne in a cup. The genus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere; it includes some 500 species, both deciduous and evergreen. Fossil oaks date back to the Middle Eocene. Molecular phylogeny shows that the genus is divided into Old World and New World clades, but many oak species hybridise freely, making the genus's history difficult to resolve.</p>

            <h2>Maple</h2>
            <p>A pine is any conifer tree or shrub in the genus Pinus (/ˈpiːnuːs/) of the family Pinaceae. Pinus is the sole genus in the subfamily Pinoideae. World Flora Online, created by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Missouri Botanical Garden, accepts 187 species names of pines as current, together with more synonyms. The American Conifer Society (ACS) and the Royal Horticultural Society accept 121 species. Pines are commonly found in the Northern Hemisphere. Pine may also refer to the lumber derived from pine trees; it is one of the more extensively used types of lumber.</p>
